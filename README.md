# Employee Relationship Management System

React app for rendering the client side of the system.


## Overview

This prototype demonstrates the concept of pre 1:1 and post 1:1. Managers get to schedule meetings with their employees, take notes, and transfer those notes to the following meetings. Both manager and employee can take personal notes about each other. This prototype was used by a startup (wwww.joinconnectus.com) to present the concept to investors and raise funds. The startup now over 500 users and has been accepted into accelerator programs.
## Architecture

This web site uses [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) bundled with 
[webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). We use [react-redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) 
for persistent state management, and [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/) 
for internal routing. [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization) is used for authentication.
## Installation

Install by doing the following:

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:Pape98/connectus.git
  yarn
  yarn start
```

It is important to note that there is a backend component that needs to run at the same
time for the client application to work.
